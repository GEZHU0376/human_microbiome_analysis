>We used QIIME 2 to perform an analysis of GI human microbiome samples from two patients at four body sites at five different timepoints. The first sample was collected immediately followed by antibiotic intake. A study based on these samples was originally published in Caporaso et al. (2011). The data used in this project were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq using the Earth Microbiome Project hypervariable region 4 (V4) 16S rRNA sequencing protocol.
